# Bowling Game

This is the first Kata that I took up since it seemed to be the most popular one out there by Uncle Bob for beginners.

Going through it, I thought it was OK, given that I had the powerpoint that Uncle Bob had put up that I just had to 
follow. I expect future Katas to be better learning experiences, given that I wont have a pre-cooked solution to work 
 off of, but this one was a good start nevertheless.
 
 This Kata, like all Katas after it, will be created as child modules within the parent Kata module.
